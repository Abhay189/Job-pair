# Basic Setup Instructions : 

## Front-end setup : 

Make sure that you have npm, npx, node.js installed.  
Clone the repo and move to `job-pair-frontend` folder.   
Install the dependencies here using `npm install` command.   
To run the Frontend use `npm start` command.   


## Guideline for adding Front-end pages : 

The Front end is divided into 4 parts, namely : Assets, Components, Pages and Styles. Make sure that you follow this pattern while adding more content into the project.   
Make your page as a react component in the `job-pair-frontend\src\Pages` sub Directory and add it to the router in the `job-pair-frontend\src\App.js` for it to be navigable.
